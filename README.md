Questions (we have so far):
1. Are there any interactions between variables that are most likely to result in a patient contracting lung cancer/which behaviors are most preventative?
2. How likely is an interactive app to predict incidences of lung cancer based on provided information?
3. How does the severity of symptoms relate to different levels of lung cancer?
